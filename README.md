# Advent of Code 2023

### Description

Doing this sucker in GoLang, it's my new favorite language for server-side applications.

### Usage

Each day is a separate package, so you can run each day with `go run day1.go` or `go run day2.go` in their respective directories.

If you wish to start a clean AOC, you can do so by deleting all of the package folders from day1 to day25, and then running `go run main.go` from the root directory.
